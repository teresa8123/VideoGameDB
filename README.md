## Overview
This is an interactive application that manages a Video Game database. The project includes functionalities to **create, update, delete, search, and export data** while using MySQL for the backend database. The schema and data are initialized based on the provided CSV files and a pre-defined Entity-Relationship diagram.

## Features

### 1. Game Search (`1_Game-Search.py`)
- Search for games by:
  - Title (prefix-based search)
  - Developer and Publisher (via radio buttons)
  - Minimum rating (slider input)
- Query involves subqueries for efficient filtering.

### 2. Store Search (`2_Store_Search.py`)
- Search for stores by their location.
- Displays matching records in a table.

### 3. User Creation (`3_Create.py`)
- Create new users with:
  - Name
  - Password
- User IDs are auto-incremented.
- View all users after insertion.

### 4. Delete Game (`4_Delete.py`)
- Mark a game as deleted (soft delete using `isDeleted` flag).
- Aggregate query displays the total number of games.
- Supports transaction management for reliability.

### 5. Export Data (`5_Export.py`)
- Export CSV files (`developer.csv`, `game.csv`, etc.) for all tables.
- Downloadable buttons are dynamically generated.

### 6. Update Game (`6_Update.py`)
- Update attributes of a game (title, genre, rating) using buttons.
- Ensures real-time updates with validation.

### 7. Database Initialization (`Hello.py`)
- Creates the required MySQL tables (`game`, `developer`, `publisher`, `store`, `user`) if they don't already exist.
- Populates tables from the provided CSV files.
- Includes:
  - Database views 
  - Placeholder support for future extensions.

### Helper Functions (`helper.py`)
- Includes utility functions to:
  - Clean and process CSV data.
  - Convert string inputs to proper data types.
  - Nicely format outputs.
